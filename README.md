# Duelity Final Project

Game Objective

Duelity is a simple arcade like game where two opponents blend in with their environment and try to shoot the other player. Once one person is tagged with a bullet, the other player wins. There will be fun environments for players to use their hiding skills. 

Find your opponent and tag them with your bullet spawner before they can do the same for you. Blend into your environment as your movement will be very slow. After every point is scored, your positions will reset into new spawn points. The first one to ten points is the winner.

To help find your opponent, look for a COMSTAT item to provide updates on your enemyâ€™s location.
